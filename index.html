		<p>Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world resulting in higher sea levels.</p>
		<p>A large rise (on the order of several feet) in global sea levels "would inundate coastal wetlands and lowlands, erode beaches, increase the risk of flooding, and increase the salinity of estuaries, aquifers, and wetlands.”</p>

		<p>As deforestation and forest degradation have such a significant impact on climate change, reducing forest loss can have multiple benefits for ecosystems and people. These include cutting greenhouse gas emissions, sequestering carbon, providing other ecosystems services, and maintaining intact, functioning forests that have the best chance of withstanding climate change.</p>
